<h1>PHP Dice Game</h1>
<p>This was a project that I had some fun with while at Code School. It's an interactive dice rolling game where you have many options to choose from.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can provide player names</li>
<li>You can choose how many times you want to roll</li>
<li>You can choose how many sides of the dice to play with</li>
<li>Rolls and Scores are tracked in the table</li>
<li>Winners and Ties are tracked at the bottom</li>
</ul>
